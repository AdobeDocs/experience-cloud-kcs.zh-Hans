# 性能测试始终访问站点根页面

## 描述


<b>环境</b>
Adobe Experience Manager AdobeCloud Manager

<b>问题</b>


```
Performance test of Cloud Manager always accesses the site root page, even if the test set is new pages.
Site root page means the URL without path (e.g. https://www.example.com).
If the site root page is not accessible, the performance test will fail.
```



## 分辨率



```
Solution
This is the expected behavior.
The "new" pages selection refers to the actual performance test.
The crawler is executed first in order to identify which pages are available.
```
